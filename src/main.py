    # TODO LIST
    # bruh. clean up code bc I'm lazy and don't want to make art
    # 1. add more towers/enemies
    # 2. make bosses
    #
    # I'll add more as I go on


    # tower upgrading ideas:
    # 1. rpg like system; gain points, upgrade different stats
    # 2. system like btd6
    # 3. branching tree system(pros: lots of variability, cons: a LOT of upgrades to make)
    # 4. place tier 1 towers and unlock it's upgrades based on it's tier; tier 1: tier 1 upgrades, tier 2: tier 2 upgrades, etc. you upgrade the tower by merging towers of the same type together
